# Web-Page-Data-Extraction-Script
This Python script reads a list of URLs from a spreadsheet, fetches the source code for each page, extracts multiple matches using a regular expression (regex) pattern, and writes the results to a new spreadsheet. Each match found on a page is written as a row in the output file.
## Prerequisites
Before you run the script, ensure you have the following installed:

* Python 3.x
* pandas library
* requests library
* openpyxl library
You can install the required libraries using pip:
~~~~
pip install pandas requests openpyxl
